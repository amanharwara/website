  It is made using the Electron framework with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
  I started creating it in the latter half of 2018 because no other desktop client for WhatsApp had a dark theme or an option for custom themes.
  Altus is still regularly maintained, with over 39,000 downloads as of writing.`,

  It is completely built with Next.js + Typescript using a flat-file approach and being mostly self-contained without using too many other dependencies.
  For the design, I went with a modern and clean look while remembering to maintain familiarity and good UX. A healthy amount of white space is used to give the design some room to breath and to keep the user's information overload to the minimal.`,
